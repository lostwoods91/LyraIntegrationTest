# LyraIntegrationTest
Try to extend Lyra by integrating a simple inventory and ability system

## How to test
1. Clone this project in the Plugins\GameFeatures folder of your Lyra project.
2. Add the Chestory Inventory System (https://www.fab.com/it/listings/f354ae92-6be2-4898-980e-c13e28a55e85) plugin to project.
3. If you get some 'Error: Native pointer usage in member declaration detected', turn off line 16 (NativePointerMemberBehaviorOverride) on LyraEditor.Target.cs: maybe you have some plugin with old-style raw pointer UPROPERTYs, as for me.
4. Add LyraIntegrationTest game feature to Lyra's B_ShooterGame_Elimination experience.
5. Play that experience from test level LyraIntegrationTest\Maps\L_IntegrationTest.

## Things I learned / things I struggled with
- Using a GameFeature plugin, a special type of plugin designed for the Modular Gameplay Features system, that can be loaded/unloaded at runtime to extend existing experience behavior.
- UChestoryFunctionLibrary::MakeItemDataFromTransfer overrides custom data with its own asset data, so I had to create a Chestory data asset for each lyra item.
- 'Error: Native pointer usage in member declaration detected' (see above) because of my FMOD installed plugin.
- Chestory's InventoryManagerComponent registration issue (see UInventoryManagerFixedComponent::OnComponentCreated() for details).
- GameFeature plugins can depend from each other! This allow me to use ShooterCore base functionalities in GameFeature plugin and extend them!
- LyraAbilitySets can grant abilities, effects and even attribute sets for you, avoiding a lot of boilerplate!

## Time spent
5 hours - experience and game feature comprehension and setup
2 hours - lyra's itemization framework comprehension
2 hours - inventory system choice and usage test
5 hours - inventory implementation (also struggled with and solved Chestory's InventoryManagerComponent registration issue)
3 hours - implement B_EquipmentSpawner and equippable items
1 hour - application of helmet's game effect
2 hours - implementation of the healing belt item, with related ability and healing game effect

## Design a Server-Authoritative Item System

- All items live on the server. The client can ask to pick something up, move it, or equip it, but the server decides if thatâ€™s valid and only then updates the item.
- There are items definitions (how an item is done) and item instances with their own state and an unique GUID (placed on world on in the player's inventory).
- The server keeps track of inventories (both world chests or pickups and players owned) in its own database.
- When a match starts, the player's selected equipment is "frozen" temporarily in the server owned player's inventory.
- When a match ends:
	- if the player survived, he get all its current items, that will be placed in it's own inventory.
	- if the player died, frozen equipment is deleted from server and the player lose it.
